# HWID-LOCK
hwid lock system made with love and care a very simple project


if you want to test and change anything feel free to.

to run localhost you would need xampp control planel when downloaded open file location and look for a folder called htdocs and make a hwid.txt or name it what ever you want and you would have to change the (name).txt
and it should work fine if any problems dm Mr Virus#9999 on discord or on github
